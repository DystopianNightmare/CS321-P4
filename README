OVERVIEW:

 In this program, GeneBankCreateBTree creates a BTree of genetic keys from a given GeneBank file and stores the 
 tree to disk in a binary file. GeneBankSearch can then search the created BTree file for Gene sequences of a 
 specified length when given a query file to reference.

INCLUDED FILES:

 * BTree.java - source file
 * BTreeNode.java - source file
 * BTreeObject.java - source file
 * Cache.java - source file
 * GeneBankCreateBTree.java - source file
 * GeneBankSearch.java - source file
 * IUSingleLinkedList.java - source file
 * SLLNode.java - source file
 * README - this file

COMPILING AND RUNNING:

 From the directory containing all source files, compile the
 driver class (and all dependencies) with the command:
 $ javac *.java

 Run the compiled class files using the commands:
 
 $ java GeneBankCreateBTree <0/1(no/with Cache)> <degree> <gbk file> <sequence length>
 [<cache size>] [<debug level>]

 $java GeneBankSearch <0/1(no/with Cache)> <btree file> <query file> [<cache size>]
 [<debug level>]
 
 Additional info: 
 
 * <degree> is the degree of the BTree (if the user specifies 0, then an optimum degree 
    is chosen by the program)
 * <sequence length> (k) is an integer that must be between 1 and 31 (inclusive)
 * <btree file> is the BTree file constructed by GeneBankCreateBTree using a
   <gbk file> and proper <sequence length>
 * <query file> should contain all the DNA strings of a specific sequence length that
   the user wants to search for in the <btree file>

PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:
 
 BTreeObject.java - Creates an object that is able to store a key(gene sequence) and its frequency
 
 BTreeNode.java - Creates a node capable of storing an array of BTreeObjects, parent and child pointers, 
 and information necessary for creating a BTree structure (if nodes are leaves/roots, the max # of children
 a node can have, offsets for storing data properly, and a sequence length). 
 
 BTree.java - This class contains the logic for storing information to disk as a Btree data structure, 
 as well as methods to access the information from the file once it is stored. As a tree is created, it takes in 
 a name for the file it will be stored in, the minimum # of children allowed per node, and a sequence length for the keys being stored. 
 As nodes are added to the tree, they are given an offset based on the number of nodes that have already been written
 to the file.

TESTING:

 This program was tested using the provided testing files and examples. When any output from the console or dump 
 files did not match the given examples appropriately, debugging was done manually in Eclipse. 


DISCUSSION:

You need to turn in a README file that describes the layout of the B-Tree file on
disk as well as any other relevant observations.
